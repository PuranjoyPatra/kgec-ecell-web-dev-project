# kgec-ecell-web-dev-project

KGEC E-Cell is Enterpreneurship cell at Kalyani Government Engineering College where i am pursuing MCA.

This is my first web development assignment from KGEC E-Cell in web dev domain.
as an intern i completed my first task.
Oruginal website of KGEC ECELL: https://kgececell.com/

This web site is almost a clone of original KGEC ECELL home page. I do not create exactly same but try to similar in my own way. The website is named as "XYZ Organization"  and developed by me. I am an Intern of KGEC ECELL as a web Developer.

i have used HTML,CSS, BOOTSTRAP 5 and JavaScript(little more).
